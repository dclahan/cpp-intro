# c++ intro stuff
c++ assignments/projects/resources that are nice to use


The [Data Structures](https://www.cs.rpi.edu/academics/courses/spring20/csci1200/calendar.php) course that I took is mostly all (some pages are password protected) available online, (also if you change spring20 to spring19 in the url or 21 or fall19,20,21 all those courses are available too and have different homeworks to practice with), the first few weeks went over some basic c++ stuff. The first lecture has some good resources about transitioning from python to c++, like [this document on exactly that](https://cs.slu.edu/~goldwasser/publications/python2cpp.pdf).


The assignments in the calendar have their OG problem statements, and downloadable files (some starter code/txt files), the [Development environment](https://www.cs.rpi.edu/academics/courses/spring20/csci1200/development_environment.php) and [installation testing](https://www.cs.rpi.edu/academics/courses/spring20/csci1200/installation_test.php) pages are good for starting out with learning about compiling/executing c++ code but you already know linux and command line stuff pretty well I bet (I didn't when I started).

Good to start with hw1 for just practice making something from scratch in C++.
